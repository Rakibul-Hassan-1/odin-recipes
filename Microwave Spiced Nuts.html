    <h1>Microwave Spiced Nuts</h1>
    <br />
    <h3 style="text-align: justify">
      This is a great microwave candied nut recipe I stole from my mom. She
      likes walnuts, and I like pecans. It's really easy. My wife says she needs
      to leave the house when I make them so she won't eat them all!
